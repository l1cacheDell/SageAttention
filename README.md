# SageAttention Integration with Paddle

Important Declaration: To adjust to paddle `phi/gpu` kernels development regulations, we have to re-construct the sageattention kernel files as simple and highly integrated as we can. We will maintain this repository and update any of the sageattn kernel's new feature into this branch. The latest update will be fetched in `main` branch, though `main` branch was not set to main in this repository, the `paddle_support` branch is, instead.
